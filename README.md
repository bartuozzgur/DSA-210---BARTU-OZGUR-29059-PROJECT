DSA 210 - BARTU OZGUR 29059 PROJECT


PROJECT OVERVIEW 
In this project the relationship between total sales of a coffee shop and current weather conditions will be analyzed. By using the dataset the correlation of total sales and weather condition will be examined.

MOTIVATION 
I choose the specific sector because it was a business model which I already work in and I have detailed information about inside process of business. So I believe I can obtain a successful project with the help of my current knowledge about it by combining my lecture knowledge of DSA 210. Weather condition has a vital impact on customer numbers of specially local coffee shops which sales of these coffee shops might get affected by every different little aspect and weather conditions is one of the most effective factor. That is why analyzing the relationship and eventually obtaining detailed information about these relationships has a vital importance for businesses.

DATA SOURCE
The needed data will be used from a local coffee shop which located in Kadiköy Bağdat Caddesi. Mentioned coffee shop hosting approximately 350 guests every single day since last 9 months. Coffee shop using a software program which is helping its operations. This software program has every order type and time in its memory for that given period. The needed detailed data of sold products with their timing analyze is stored in an application of software program which I have my accessibility on it every aspects. Therefore, I have an already collected and sufficiently detailed data to use it in this project.

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
After analyzing the relationship between weather and total sales and obtaining an information, the relationship of detailed analyze of specific sale amounts of products of coffee shop and weather might be analyzed by addition to analyzing only total sales. This kind of different analyzes can give more deeply information about external factors. That possibility shows that there is more room to evaluate this project in different aspects of business in future.
